# Simple-Percolation-Program

A percolation process demonstrated by a grid where which user can enter the row and column size for the grid, and numbers and spaces will be generated within the grid randomly, which will ultimately check whether there are spaces in each row and show 
the user of the final output of the percolation process. This project was created for my 2nd semester Programming module in my Foundation Degree Program at IIT.
